# Analysing Impact of US – China Trade War on Large Tech Stocks : Forecasting Price of Large Tech Stocks using  ARIMA Modelling and the Comparison of Returns from US and Chinese Stocks

This study has been undertaken to investigate the effect of the US-Chinese trade war on the returns of the large tech stocks based on both these countries. Due to the US-China trade war and other regulatory concerns, there has been lot of volatility in different Chinese tech stocks. As a result, as reported by CNBC on 20th September 2018, more than $168 billion had been wiped off from the total market cap of major Chinese tech stocks, creating an international concern over them. We use ARIMA modelling in order to predict the returns of the four major tech stocks based in US and China, in next 3 months using past 1 year’s data. This also helps us to scientifically explain the reason of steady growth in US stocks, and the downfall of major Chinese tech stocks, with the support of past data on these stocks.
